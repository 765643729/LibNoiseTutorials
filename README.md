# Examples for LibNoise.Unity

This tutorial repository aims to follow the original LibNoise tutorials, [which you can find here at SourceForge](http://libnoise.sourceforge.net/tutorials/).

The main repository for LibNoise.Unity is currently maintained by
[Ricardo J. Méndez](https://github.com/ricardojmendez). Pull requests
are welcome.

# A word on methodology

Since these are tutorial examples, I expect I’ll just run development straight off master.  The LibNoise.Unity repository does follow git flow, so expect this tutorial repository will be a work-in-progress and might at any given point reference a LibNoise development branch.

# Checking out the repository

It includes the LibNoise.Unity Github repository as a submodule.   If you have just cloned the project and find missing behaviors, make sure that:

* You actually have some files inside the Assets/LibNoise folder;
* You have run _git submodule update_ to check out the latest referenced version;

Or you could use an application like [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) which handles the submodule semantics for you.
